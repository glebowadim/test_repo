# Action Items

The Action Item module is designed to track actions and tasks related to sites, projects, and meetings so everything is connected and together in one place.

- The Action Item portal lists all action items and can be easily sorted and filtered by status, owner, category, due date, age.
- Users can add and update action item records from the grid or in the summary tab. 
- The calendar page shows the due date and forecast date for each action. 
- The card view page organizes each action by category and days until the forecast finish date. <br />

- The Action Items donâ€™t have to be related to anything, so this can be used for general actions related to multiple sites or other parts of the business.
- The reminder feature can be used to send an email to the assigned user and action followers at a future date.
- The history field retails the username and date of each comment and tracks the time since last comment.  
- Action task fields can be used to keep track of sub-tasks or actions related to the action item.
- The chat feature is enabled to allow users to collaborate and track progress to the action.
